===

This is a fork of [XGS ](https://github.com/jmthompson/xgs), a Linux-based Apple IIGS emulator.


# About This Version

Changes have been made so it compiles on windows, linux, and macOSX 10.15.

# Compiling

To compile this code you will need

- CMake
- c++17 capable compiler
- The Boost format and program_options libraries
- SDL2
- SDL2_ttf

To build XGS, from the source directory run:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make 
```

The binary will be compiled to build/xgs.

# Usage
**On mac/linux:**

Before starting XGS for the first time you'll need to create the XGS home directory
and copy some files into it.

First, from the source directory run:

```
mkdir ~/.xgs
cp fonts/xgs{4,8}0.fnt ~/.xgs/
```

You'll need an Apple IIGS ROM file (either v01 or v03 will work):

```
cp PATH_TO_YOUR_ROM_FILE ~/.xgs/xgs.rom
```

Now you can start XGS as follows (-3 is only needed if your ROM image is v03):

```
./build/xgs -3
```

You can also display the help text if you need help with the command-line options:

```
./build/xgs --help
```
**On Windows:**

```
Copy all the dll files from your SDL2/lib/x64 folder and 
all the fonts from the xgs/font folder and 
your xgs.rom file into the same folder as the xgs.exe 
then double click on the exe.
```
